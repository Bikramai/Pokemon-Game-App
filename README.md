Project Documentation OF Pokémon
Overview
This document provides an overview of the Pokémon Battle project, detailing the technologies used, the development process, challenges faced, lessons learned, and the business benefits.

Technologies
Frontend
•	React: For building the user interface and managing state.
•	JavaScript: For scripting and interaction within the application.
•	CSS: For styling the components.
•	HTML: For structuring the web pages.

Backend
•	Node.js: For the server-side runtime environment.
•	Express.js: For building the REST API and handling server-side logic.
•	JWT: For authentication and authorization.
•	Axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

Database
•	SQLite:  For storing user data, Pokémon data, and battle records.

What Did You Build?
•	We built a Pokémon Battle web application that allows users to:
•	Fetch Battle Data: Users can input an opponent's name to fetch their Pokémon data and prepare for a battle.
•	Start a Battle: Users can select their Pokémon and an opponent's Pokémon to start a battle.
•	View Pokémon: Users can view their own Pokémon and their opponent's Pokémon, along with their stats (HP, Attack, and Defense).
•	Authentication: Secure login and authentication using JWT.
•	
What Did We Learn After Completing Our Project?
•	React State Management: How to effectively manage state in a React application using hooks like use State and use Effect.
•	API Integration: How to integrate a frontend application with a backend API using Axios for making HTTP requests.
•	Authentication: Implementing secure user authentication using JWT.
•	Error Handling: Effective error handling techniques in both frontend and backend.
•	Asynchronous Operations: Handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript using async/await.
Business Benefit
•	Engaging User Experience: Provides an engaging platform for users to battle their Pokémon, enhancing user retention and satisfaction.
•	Data-Driven Insights: Collecting battle data allows for insights into user preferences and behaviors, which can inform future features and improvements.
•	Scalability: Built with scalable technologies, allowing for easy expansion and addition of new features.
•	Security: Implementing JWT for secure authentication ensures user data is protected.
•	Competitive Edge: Offers a unique feature set that can attract Pokémon enthusiasts and differentiate from competitors.
